      "Will you love me as I am? / Take on me like a birdie in the hand / Will you sing me like a song? / Tune me into the mel-o-dy you carry along / inside of you / Will you wind my line 'round yr book of had days? / I'm curling out like a spiral here and there on the page / The dog with the mannish face / can bury me / like a capsule lapsing time / and I'll grow / heaven know / like a rose!\n\nFind a stud in the wall, and I'll hang us a painting that'll never fall / the color to your magic eye / a'hanging / over and over / the breath of the bleeding sun / over and over / the mountain, a megaton / over and over / the spread of the day and night / over and over and over / to reckon with the recondite\n\nWill you twirl me in your hands ? / Our fires shrink as the universe expands / But will you find your way by feel ? / See me into the parts that you see fit to reveal / or vanish in / And when we find ourselves in a zombie space / I'll screw my eyes to immobilize my face / in the dark / a gather of lifeless weight / re-animate! / re-animate all the damn time / and I do / heaven knew / so do you\n\nFind a stud in the wall, and I'll hang us a painting that'll never fall / a color to your magic eye / a'hanging / over and over / the breath of the bleeding sun / over and over / the mountains of megatons / over and over / the spread of the day and night / over and over and over / to reckon with the recondite"

    lyric1:
      "How to sleep. The first thing you should try is ask your parents for some sleeping powder sprinkled on your tongue. It maybe tastes like salt, but it is really fairy magic.\n\nNumber two is wrap yourself up tightly like a mummy in a tomb. Lay on your back with both arms underneath the covers. Reach across your body, wrap the sheets around your arms to pin them to your chest.\n\n\tFall asleep how-to.\n\tFall asleep.\n\tHow to fall asleep.\n\nNumber three is think of all the people in your family. One by one, picture their faces. Try to hear their voices in your ear. Then, gently, put them all to bed inside your mind.\n\nFor four, you'll need to find a doll or animal to hug, but everytime you squeeze, imagine there's a giant version of the doll, and you are in it's arms, and it is really hugging you.\n\n\tFall asleep how-to.\n\tFall asleep.\n\tHow to fall asleep.\n\nNumber five. Not everybody knows this one, but when your eyes are closed, your bed does not stay on the floor. It floats around the room or hovers high above the Earth. Its hard to see, because every time you peek, the bed goes back to where it was.\n\nAnd six is just pretend to be asleep.\n\nIf none of those things work, then climb into your parents' bed, or better yet, your sister's.\n\n\tHow to fall asleep.\n\tHow to fall asleep.\n\tHow to fall asleep."
